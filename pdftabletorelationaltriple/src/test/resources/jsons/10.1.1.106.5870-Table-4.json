Fast Start\nis enabled by almost all Windows media servers in order to\nreduce the startup buffering time for clients. Basically, Fast\nStart transmits data to the client as fast as possible until\nthe play-out buffer is filled. After the Fast Start period,\nFast Cache streams media data until the entire object is de-\nlivered or the session is terminated by the user. In order\nto smooth out network bandwidth fluctuations, Fast Cache\ntransmits media data to a client at a speed usually up to\n5 times the media encoding rate and the client maintains a\ngrowing buffer for the early arrived data.\nTable 4 shows the total volume of streaming traffic deliv-\nered over Fast Cache (FC), normal TCP streaming excluding\nFC (TCP), and UDP streaming (UDP) in our workloads. As\nthe table shows, Fast Cache is widely used by both third-\nparty hosting services and self-hosting services, accounting\nfor 50.1% and 21.0% of the streaming traffic in the home and\nbusiness user workloads, respectively. There is less stream-\ning traffic delivered over Fast Cache in the business user\nworkload than in the home user workload, because the ac-\ncess pattern of business users is different from that of home\nusers. Business users access more audio and live media than\nhome users. Audio media objects have low bit rates and\nusually do not need Fast Cache, while live media objects\n"],"Page":7,"Number":4,"Type":"Table","CaptionBB":[465,308,746,321],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[437,329,779,395]}
